# extra-simple-python-ping-checker
Used to ping a server to test latency in a VERY simple way. (Originally made a while ago to test when my ping was good to a Minecraft server to know when to start playing.)

(I don't know why you would want to use this but thought I would made the very simple SRC public since I never make stuff public.)
